# Data replication and extension homework

Greetings,

I completed a university course, which was about critically reviewing and testing a scientific economic publication.

For this homework, I chose the following article *The Impact of the Gig Economy on Product Quality Through the Labor Market: Evidence from Ridesharing and Restaurant Quality* from 
the following website: https://ejd.econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/ , as it provides original data. 

The task consisted of four parts:

#### 1. Critical Review of the Methods, Data, and Hypotheses
#### 2. Replication of the Main Tables and Graphs
#### 3. Additional Robustness Tests
#### 4. Dataset Extension

For the Dataset Extension part, I used data sets from Google Trends, aggregated and merged them with the original dataset.
